## <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> Hey, this is Salik

I have a passion for **medicine**, **business**, and **technology**. I am currently pursuing an MBA in NYC while on leave from my MD program in Houston.

I started this blog as a way to document and share the things I have learned and found useful in my journey as a medical student, business leader, and technology enthusiast. My primary focus is on the intersection of healthcare, business, and technology.

Writing and noting things down is a great way for me to solidify my understanding of new concepts and technologies, and I hope that my blog can be a helpful resource for others who are interested in these fields.

I would be highly appreciated if you could leave your comments and thoughts on what I have written <Twemoji emoji="Smiling Face with Sunglasses" />.

## Why have this blog?

> Putting ideas into words is a severe test. The first words you choose are usually wrong; you have to rewrite sentences over and over to get them exactly right. And your ideas won't just be imprecise, but incomplete too. Half the ideas that end up in an essay will be ones you thought of while you were writing it. Indeed, that's why I write them. - Paul Graham
